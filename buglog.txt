Fixed in 10 minutes
Had to switch bounds of FONT_HEIGHT and FONT_WIDTH in i and j in nested for loop in textToGraphics function

ISSUE 4:
10/4/19
When typing text into status bar, all text would slowly travel left as more text was typed
Fixed in 30 minutes
Had to adjust alignment values

ISSUE 5:

Text was misaligned. Status message would roll over and the end of message would be at the beginning of the status bar
Fixed in 5 minutes
Had to set alignment value of textToGraphics call in create_status_bar function to "center" rather than "right"

ISSUE 6:
10/6/19
Status bar was flickering again, even though it was at the bottom
Fixed in 1 hour
Had to synchronize the call to create_status_bar in adventure.c by making it grab the msg_lock before and releasing the msg_lock after the call

ISSUE 7:
10/6/19
Underscore would not show up on status bar
Fixed in 30 minutes
Had to define a variable underscore in create_status_bar and then call textToGraphics.
Then realized that it still would not show up I had to create another alignment value specifically
to account for the underscore.

ISSUE 8:
10/6/19
Underscore overlapped with other characters being typed and would not disappear when 20th character was typed
Fixed in 1 hour
Had to create special condition in create_status_bar function which tested if the inputted text was less than 20 characters.
Would then make underscore disappear once 20th character was typed. offset the alignment for first 19 characters by 2 pixels
to account for space for underscore. 20th character would replace underscore, making it look like demo

ISSUE 9:
